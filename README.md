# GPB_TicTacToe_Project
Greetings,

This project and all of its contents are a joint venture between myself and Adam for a Westwood Game porting basics class.  Our project was to take Tic Tac Toe and give it a minor face lift and have it work on Linux, Mac and Windows.

This project was written using C++ OOP and SDL2 library from Simple Direct Media.  The link will be provided below.  Using Microsoft's Visual studios 2013 we configured and compiled our project using the basic's from LazyFoo's website.  That link will also be provided below.

Please enjoy and have fun.<br><br>
Respectfully,<br>
Westwood Students
